# Classification-Models-for-Red-Wine-Dataset

The dataset used has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information regarding the acidity, density, pH level, amount of sulphates and chlorides, etc. Different classification machine learning models have been used to divide the variants of red wine into two categories, high-quality wine and low-quality wine. 

Python along with its different libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib have been used to analyse and visualize the data, and Scikit-Learn has been used to build classification models and make predictions about the dataset.
